    Learn how to switch

    Angle class:
        get degrees
        get radians

    Plane operations:
        Find plane with normal vector through a point
        Find plane through three points
        Find plane parallel to plane and passes through point
        Find plane normal to a vector and passes through a point
        Find angle between planes
        Find plane with two parametrized vectors
        Find plane through point with a normal vector
        Are two planes parallel
        Are two planes orthogonal

    Vector operations:

        make a way to input fractions
            prolly way too hard

        Find Area function
        Find Magnitude function
        Find Normal Vector to a plane
        Find Normal Vector to a plane created by three points
        Find parameterized line through a point and orthogonal to plane
        Find parameterized line through a point and parallel to plane

    Point(s):
        Find intersection point of a plane and a parametrized vector
        Find Area from three points

    Angles:
        Find angle between two planes

    Add:
        get Vector projected along another Vector
        get Vector perpendicular to another Vector

    Vector:
        getUnitVector modifies itself instead of returning a Vec.
